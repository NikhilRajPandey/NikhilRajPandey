### Maths + Programming
-   [Sin Finder](https://github.com/nikhilrajpandey/sinFinder)
    This is a simple program for calculating sin of any angle.In this Program I have not just use the math library to calculate the sin of angle but instead i have written my own function for it in main.cpp and also writted the algorithm in algorithm.txt.
    
-   [Polynomial Divide](https://github.com/nikhilrajpandey/Polynomial_divide)
    This is a program to calculate divison for two polynomials in C++ that we have read in class(IX/X) Like If this is divisor "-x<sup>2</sup>+x-1" and this is dividend then "-x<sup>3</   sup>+3x<sup>2</sup>-3x+5" Then it will return Quoitent +1x-2 and Reminder +3
    
-   [RamanjumHardyNumber Generator](https://github.com/nikhilrajpandey/RamanujamHardyNumberGenerator)
    This is a simple c++ program to print 100 RamanujamHardyNumbers(TaxiCab) by computation.

### C/C++ Programs

    In this program I writed function to convert Integer to string from scratch.

### Python Projects
